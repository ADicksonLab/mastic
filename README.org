** TODO Assertion type checking

Might want to replace most of my type checks with assert statements or
something similar to 

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  if __debug__:
      if not isinstance(other, Molecule):
          raise TypeError("Other must be type Molecule, not {}".format(type(other)))
#+END_SRC

Both will be removed when the number of checks in the code when using the
optimize option like ~python -O code.py~.

This allows us to make it faster when we know the code runs and
doesn't need the checks.

Also using asserts could clean up the code a lot. Keeping the full
__debug__ business would allow for using my own exception types if I
really wanted it.
