** TODO evaluate the subspace map method in interaction spaces

We need it internally for getting things by their association
and interaction type efficiently.

** TODO tests for None selection id

** DONE only find interactions between the association selections
Right now it finds all of interactions between members and just takes
out the intramember interactions.
** TODO implement slice inputs for selection ids
** TODO SystemMemberType class may be needed
Currently I have multiple Type members allowed in a system which are
not identified by anything except their index in the system. Perhaps a
SystemMember class would alleviate this and give consistency to the
different kind of members.

Of course you can just always make you MoleculeTypes and AtomTypes etc
named to reflect that they are indeed different things in the system.
i.e. a protein dimer.
** TODO migrate Association and AssociationTYpe to system.py
** DONE consolidate SystemAssociation and Association to just Association
** DONE unittests with finding features functions
I was reluctant to use these because rdkit gives me trouble sometimes.
** TODO Type.substantiate function
A general function for use every Type class instead of specific
to_molecule and to_atom methods which need to be handled individually,
e.g. in to_system.

** TODO Type class for things to inherit from.
Would at least provide an interface to implement and override. Need
not be too picky.
** TODO coord_array and array_idx constructor options for Molecule constructor
** DONE finish system and molecule getters for atom, bond, molecule etc classes
** DONE automatically set the in_molecule and in_system flags when the registry of elements are changed
** DONE type constructor and to_molecule, to_atom, to_bond
** TODO BondType and MoleculeType methods for getting adjacent AtomTypes
** DONE make the AtomType class declaration like BondType and MoleculeType
** DONE AtomType, BondType, MoleculeType
** TODO AngleType implementation 
** TODO Atom.__getitem__ should retrieve something more meaningful
Like say the dimension component.

** TODO Docstring for register_selection

SHould have an example of a GenericSelection subclass using this.

** TODO Container class implementation
A class for this would reduce redundancy in checking whether each
element is a SelectionMember.

Should allow for insertion of bare containers, like lists, and have
them internally cast to Container classes.

And then the user has the option of declaring them beforehand or not.

** TODO cast elements of containers to SelectionMembers if not specified
Should make it possibly to simply make a Selection from
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  idxsel = IndexedSelection([1,2,3,4], sel=[0,2])
  idxsel[0]

  # returns SelectionMember(1)
#+END_SRC

** DONE Selection class

Right now it makes a dictionary with the keys being the indices from
the sel key-word argument passed in.

Maybe this can stay the same but this leads to obnoxious behavior in
which you don't have a simple list to iterate through but dictionary
records.

Thus I want just a Selection class that simply puts them into a list
and you access them with all the typical list methods.

The IndexedSelection will just be a dictionary with keys enforced to
be >= 0 ints.

*** DONE class

*** DONE docstring
*** DONE tests

** DONE CoordArraySelection refactor inheritance

Do I want it to be a dictionary style or Selection inheritance.
FIgure this out and change in code.

It now just behaves like a list with a manually added data attribute
and a __getitem__ method.

** DONE SelectionType factory

It seems that there should be something for defining a class of
SelectionTypes such that they must have certain attributes.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  mol_attrs = ['name', 'pdb_symbol', 'atom_types']
  MoleculeType = SelectionTypeFactory(mol_attrs)

  water_type = MoleculeType(name="water",
               pdb_symbol="H2O",
               atom_types=['H', 'H', 'O'])

  coords = np.array([[0,0,1], [1,0,0], [0,1,0]])

  water_type.to_molecule(coords)
#+END_SRC


This pattern more or less is implemented for AtomType, BondType, and
MoleculeType see those for reference.

** DONE refactor RDKitMoleculeType class into reader and MoleculeType class

Most of what is in RDKitMoleculeType should be in MoleculeType and
RDKitMoleculeType just needs to be a thin wrapper of MoleculeType with
the to_molecule_from_conformer(conf_idx) function and a get conformer
function.

That way we can read in an RDKitMoleculeType and use that to cast to
the mast agnostic MoleculeType for production.

** DONE make the SystemType and AssociationType classes mean something

Currently they are just stubs. They should have their own libraries.

** TODO make the SystemMember class

This will handle the functions for being a part of a system.

I want to implement a function that recursively searches the registry
for something that is in a system for this.

** TODO handle and create angles in MoleculeType
** TODO allow for parametrized overlap tolerances in Molecule.overlaps
** DONE handle intramember_interactions in Association.profile_interactions
eliminated the need for handling
