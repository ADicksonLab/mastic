* Setting up the System

** Collecting the Molecular Data
The trypsin-benzamidine system consists of simply the trypsin protein
and the small molecule benzamidine which is an inhibitor of trypsin.

We will build up the system using other python libraries to accomplish
the parsing of the relevant files for the molecular topology and
positions.

Loading atomic coordinates is simply reading in an xyz array and can
be done by many libraries.

Creating a molecular topology is a bit more complicated especially
when the input file format (the Protein DataBank) does not require
explicit connection information. Thus, many readers which infer
connectivity correctly from PDBs are available and the MAST library
delegates that task to one of those libraries.

An even more difficult problem is the identification of chemical
groups and other relevant features from molecular topologies. Again
MAST does not perform this function in favor allowing this kind of
information to be produced by more specialized libraries and converted
to MAST data structures.

A library that accomplishes the parsing of topologies and
identification of chemical features (as well as coordinates in a
limited manner) is RDKit which is mainly programmed in C++ with Python
bindings.

Thus for the early implementations of MAST RDKit was used to produce
the needed inputs for constructing systems, and has a submodule in the
interfaces module that includes a wrapper for converting RDKit objects
to MAST objects and extracting the useful information RDKit discovers
about chemicals.

*** Preparing chemical data with RDKit

We start with strings for the files saved in MAST for examples.

We are loading in two files for Benzamidine in order to get the
correct identification of chemical features. First the .mol format
file which contains better topological information than the .pdb,
which is used for the coordinates in the .pdb (e.g. crystal structure
analysis) or to simply assign the correct indexing of atoms for loading in
coordinates from simulations started with the .pdb.

We choose not to remove the hydrogens because we will be using them
for identifying hydrogen bonds.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  from rdkit import Chem
  import mast.tests.data as mastdata

  BEN_MOL_rdkit = Chem.MolFromMolBlock(mastdata.benzamidine_MOL, sanitize=True)
  BEN_PDB_rdkit = Chem.MolFromPDBBlock(mastdata.BEN_Hs_3ptb, removeHs=False, sanitize=True)
  trypsin_rdkit = Chem.MolFromPDBBlock(mastdata.trypsin_3ptb, removeHs=False, sanitize=True)
#+END_SRC

If you have files you want to read use the rdkit.Chem.MolFromPDBFile
etc. instead.

To get the correct atom indices and assign the correct bond order
properties for Benzamidine we use the AssignBondOrdersFromTemplate
function in rdkit.

However due to some issues in RDKit I have included a modified version
of this function in the rdkit interface submodule which we will use in
this tutorial.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  from mast.interfaces.rdkit import AssignBondOrdersFromTemplate

  BEN_rdkit = AssignBondOrdersFromTemplate(BEN_MOL_rdkit, BEN_PDB_rdkit)
#+END_SRC


*** Extracting data from RDKit objects

Now that we have rich representations of molecules in RDKit form we
want to convert these to MAST representations.

The first step is to make a wrapper object for each molecule. This has
been designed to extract a lot of important information in an
automated way.

Here we also name these structures, this will later go into making the
class name for the MoleculeTypes so choose carefully.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  from mast.interfaces.rdkit import RDKitMoleculeWrapper

  BEN_rdkit_wrapper = RDKitMoleculeWrapper(BEN_rdkit, mol_name="BEN")
  trypsin_rdkit_wrapper = RDKitMoleculeWrapper(trypsin_rdkit, mol_name="Trypsin")

#+END_SRC

Now that we have the wrapper we can extract the coordinates if we
choose to:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  BEN_coords = BEN_rdkit_wrapper.get_conformer_coords(0)
  trypsin_coords = trypsin_rdkit_wrapper.get_conformer_coords(0)
#+END_SRC

And importantly we have the method that converts the RDKit Molecule to
a mast.molecule.MoleculeType.

A mast MoleculeType is used define the topology of a molecule. It
consists of AtomTypes, BondTypes, and potentially other BondTypes (not
yet implemented). AtomTypes are objects that represent different
atoms, which are able to be defined differently for different domain
specific needs such as atom types in molecular dynamics force
fields. Different from force field atom types, in MAST each atom in a
molecular topology has its own AtomType so as to distinguish them from
each other in the molecular graph. The same is true for BondTypes and
each are identified by a unique index and name.

When we make a MoleculeType from the RDKitMoleculeWrapper object the
AtomTypes and BondTypes are generated automatically.

This could simply be achieved like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  BEN_Molecule = BEN_rdkit_wrapper.make_molecule_type()
#+END_SRC

However, we want also to use RDKit's chemical feature finding
capabilities so we specify to find_features. The default is to not
find features because for large structures (like proteins) this takes
a very long time to do so.

For the small molecule benzamidine using RDKit this is not a problem
and RDKit does a great job.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  BEN_Molecule = BEN_rdkit_wrapper.make_molecule_type(find_features=True)
#+END_SRC

For proteins RDKit makes no assumptions based on amino acid structures
so it takes a long time! Hopefully, future libraries will improve this
situation.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  Trypsin_Molecule = trypsin_rdkit_wrapper.make_molecule_type(find_features=True)
#+END_SRC

Take some time to explore this object and see how all the relevant
information is stored in it allowing for an exploratory analysis and
introspection.

But now that you have this representation we
can at least make a persistent object on the hard drive so you can
just load it later. We will do this for the whole system but you might
want a copy of the protein now in case you screw up later and need to
restart.

For this we will just use python's pickle module.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  import os.path as osp
  import pickle

  trypsin_pkl_path = osp.join(".", "TrypsinMoleculeType.pkl")
  with open(trypsin_pkl_path, 'wb') as wf:
      pickle.dump(Trypsin_Molecule, wf)

#+END_SRC

** Putting the System together

Now we have assembled all the parts needed to construct the
system. Notice we have not actually used any of the coordinates
yet. We wont until we want to actually analyze interactions. The
separation of Atom, Molecule, System types without coordinates is
important because it allows us to focus on the topology, features, and
domain specific information of our system and specify that without
having to think about coordinates until absolutely necessary. When
analysing large coordinate datasets, which may be cumbersome to load
into memory, we may want to leverage special techniques for dealing
with that data. The "types" provide a template which we can just point
at some chunk of coordinates and preserve all of our knowledge.

In short is just hygenic to keep the two separate.

To create the system really all we need to do is just provide a list
of the members that are a part of that list, give it a name, and
optionally assign further domain specific metadata to the system.

While it may seem trivial to do so we gain some important
functionality of acting on this agglomeration. Firstly, we have easy
object persistence (through pickling etc). Second, we have a clean
interface to acting on this data through the object methods (data +
processing). Third, our conceptual understanding of the systems is
refined and clarified.

Member types of a system are typically MoleculeTypes but can also be
single AtomTypes, and potentially many other non-physical or
multiphysics entities.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  import mast.system as mastsys

  member_types = [BEN_Molecule, Trypsin_Molecule]
  system_attrs = {'molecule_source' : 'rdkit'}
  Trypsin_Benzamidine_System = mastsys.SystemType("Trypsin_Benzamidine_System",
                                                  member_types=member_types,
                                                  ,**system_attrs)
#+END_SRC

Again take some time to explore this object at the IPython terminal.

** Defining associations between members of the system
Another important feature of SystemTypes is the ability to define
associations between elements within the system that may or may not be
connected through chemical bonds.

This aligns with natural notions of molecular complexes, such as
ligand-protein interactions, protein-protein interactions or even
intraprotein interactions that form secondary and tertiary structure.

This isn't particularly novel but most software and file formats do
not provide a way of conveniently dealing with these types
relationships.

You can manually define AssociationTypes as I will show in the next
code block or you can use some of the methods the SystemType class
provides for automatically generating AssociationTypes between all
combinations of system members and defining an *interaction space* for
profiling interactions when coordinates are included. I will show this
in the interaction profiling section for simplicity here.

Defining a simple receptor-ligand association that associates the
ligand to the whole protein. Later we can control the granularity of
associations to only part of members (e.g. for ligand-binding site
interactions) but for now lets just choose one against the other in
whole.

#+BEGIN_SRC python

  # these variables are used to define selections of only part of system
  # members, which we will ignore for now
  selection_map = {0 : None, 1 : None}
  selection_types = [None, None]

  rec_lig_attrs = {'info' : 'receptor-ligand'}
  Trypsin_Benzamidine_Association = \
              mastsys.AssociationType("Trypsin_Benzamidine_Association",
                                      system_type=Trypsin_Benzamidine_System,
                                      selection_map=selection_map,
                                      selection_types=selection_types,
                                      ,**rec_lig_attrs)
#+END_SRC


Now that we have the association we want to make sure the system knows
about it.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  Trypsin_Benzamidine_System.add_association_type(Trypsin_Benzamidine_Association)
#+END_SRC

Again the definition of an AssociationType may seem trivial and even
obnoxious, however by being careful and identifying the relationships
we care about up front frees us up to focus on the coordinate data
later without having to keep all the complicated matching of members
and features in our heads. When it comes to interaction profiling the
AssociationType is key in coordination.

** Making associations between parts of molecules

For instance if we only want to profile the interactions of the ligand
and some set of atoms we designate as the binding site we define a new
AssociationType.

For this example I will use some capabilities of MAST which combines
the coordinates with the Type information. We will use the coordinates
that we got from the crystal structure to define a "binding site"
using a distance cutoff. Once we know the AtomTypes that make up the
crystal structure binding site we can tell these to the
AssociationType.

Before we start adding coordinates I will introduce some nonstandard
nomenclature that is useful for identifying MAST objects. Up until now
we have only created XXXType objects with no coordinate data. We call
the objects which have associated with them both a Type and
coordinates a *substantiation* of the Type. This is so chosen because
we can think of a type as being given substance in the real 3D
world. This is meant to sound similar and allude to the
Object-Oriented programming concept of instantiation, but it is indeed
very different technically. For reference a Trypsin_Molecule is an
instantiation of the MoleculeType class while the substantiation of
the Trypsin_Molecule is an instantiation of the Molecule class and
thus are not related via the programming language but the knowledge of
the physical system.

Similarly substantiations of relations like AssociationTypes are
Associations, except Associations merely point to objects with
coordinates. Although depending on what your doing you could indeed
assign coordinates to an Association to somehow parametrize it.

So first we use the coordinates we obtained from RDKit from the
crystal structure PDB files and substantiate the Trypsin and
Benzamidine MoleculeTypes to make Molecules in a System.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  # put them together in the order they are as system members
  member_coords = [BEN_coords, trypsin_coords]

  # substantiate the system
  system = Trypsin_Benzamidine_System.to_system(member_coords)
#+END_SRC

Take a look on the terminal at this object and see how it differs from
the system as well as how you can do a lot of introspection about the
system and it's properties.

Now that we have a substantiated System we can calculate distances
between atoms. We will use some MAST functions to do so and find the
atoms on Trypsin that are close to Benzamidine.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  binding_site_cutoff_dist = 4 #in Angstroms \AA

  # find the atoms within this distance
  binding_site_atoms = system.molecules[0].atoms_within_distance(
      binding_site_cutoff_dist)

  # get the indices of these atoms to define the AssociationType
  binding_site_atom_idxs = [system.molecules[1].atoms.index(atom) for
                            atom in binding_site_atoms]

  # you might also want to get the pdb serial numbers so you can
  # visually check to see where these atoms are
  binding_site_atom_serials = [atom.atom_type.pdb_serial_number for atom
                               in binding_site_atoms]
#+END_SRC

This example also shows how you can retrieve saved information from
the atoms and their atom types to help you quickly analyze the nature
and properties of these atoms.

Usage of these properties in the AtomType namespace also keeps the API
clean in the atom namespace allowing for much more pleasurable
exploratory analysis.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  # the selection map tells the association the index of the member and
  # the indices of the atoms to include as one component of the
  # association. By selection None as the indices no selection will be
  # made and the whole molecule will be a component
  selection_map = [(1, binding_site_atom_idxs), (0, None)]

  # The selection types correspond to the elements in the selection map
  # and tell the AssociationType what kind of selection to make on the
  # molecule. Setting one of them to None should mean the selection map
  # also had no indices selected and it should use the whole system
  # member. The MoleculeAtomSelection allows for selection of atoms in a
  # Molecule or MoelculeType.
  selection_types = [mastmol.MoleculeAtomSelection, None]

  # instantiate the association
  TrypsinBS_Benzamidine_assoc = mastsys.AssociationType("TrypsinBS-Benzamidine",
                                           system_type=Trypsin_Benzamidine_System,
                                           selection_map=selection_map,
                                           selection_types=selection_types)

  # add it to the system
  Trypsin_Benzamidine_System.add_association_type(TrypsinBS_Benzamidine_assoc)

#+END_SRC

** Saving the SystemType
Now that we have a system defined and associations in that system
defined and instantiated lets make a persistent copy on the hard
drive. This will allow us to load it up when we get new data without
having to go through this process. 

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  import os.path as osp
  import pickle

  system_pkl_path = osp.join(".", "trypsin_benzamidine_system.pkl")
  with open(system_pkl_path, 'wb') as wf:
      pickle.dump(Trypsin_Benzamidine_System, wf)

#+END_SRC


*** A note on persistence, file formats, and sharing
In the future I would like to see a file format (HDF5 idaelly)
tailored specifically to these types of systems so that they can
easily be shared and compared. Currently the focus is on single
molecule formats because that is the kind of data that has typically
been available. While formats like the PDB can be used for this they
are terribly cumbersome to work with, have limits to numerical to
precision, not scalable to large numbers of atoms due to line limits,
and do not allow for the addition of important metadata in an easily
parseable way. While this has attempted to be alleviated with new PDBx
format ultimately the PDB was designed for the deposition of
crystallographic information in another age. Meanwhile, fields like
meteorology and physics have developed general binary file formats
(HDF5 and NetCDF) for dealing with large complicated data sets that
have amazing tool chains in many languages for working with
them. Imagine if your collaborator sent you not just a folder full of
pdfs but a fully annotated system that could be used immediately for
simulations etc. This will be necessary as the scale of investigations
in biomolecular sciences get bigger and include many different
molecules in large complexes with precise geometries and
interactions. Such data is already being collected in new state of the
art cryo-EM experiments.

This would make possible the creation of a repository for ready made
systems that computational scientists could have right off of the
shelf instead of spending considerable time and effort re-creating
complicated systems. Which is often a reason complicated real-life
systems are avoided.

Furthermore, coupling of these systems to force fields could make
running simulations of complex systems accessible to even non-experts.


** Profiling interactions from a multi-molecule system

One of the main motivations for the creation of MAST was the need to
profile intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonds and pi-pi
interactions in drug-protein simulation data.

*** Simple profiling

Once the system and association types are defined this can be really
easy. All you really need is to tell the association which types of
interactions to look for.

Here we will profile the ligand with the whole protein.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  from mast.interactions.hydrogen_bond import HydrogenBondType

  # substantiate the system with the new association
  system = Trypsin_Benzamidine_System.to_system(member_coords)

  # profile for interactions of HydrogenBondType in the 0th association
  tryp_ben_prof_results = new_system.associations[0].profile_interactions([HydrogenBondType])
#+END_SRC

We can also easily profile the ligand-binding site interactions since
we already defined that association.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  # the 1st association which was binding site to ligand
  tryp_ben_prof_results = new_system.associations[1].profile_interactions([HydrogenBondType])
#+END_SRC

Hopefully you think that all that trouble making the system at the
beginning was worth it now.

*** More details on the profile_interactions method
There is a lot hidden under the covers here having to do
with FeatureType, Feature, InteractionType, and Interaction classes.

While these are all things many users will want to know about and
customize for their application.

In short the FeatureTypes are what the RDKit software identified for
us when we created the MoleculeTypes and were carried around since
then. These FeatureTypes are made of selections of atoms in the
molecule and correspond to things like h-bond acceptors and h-bond
donors as well as more complicated things like aromatic rings or amino
and hydroxyl groups. RDKit assigns them strings based on what it
considers them and MAST assigns each distinct FeatureType an
object and an index in the MoleculeType.

When profile_interactions is called it looks through all the features
it has and checks if they are potentially part of HydrogenBondType
interactions. HydrogenBondType only needs two features and so all the
pairs of donor and acceptor features in the association are identified
and and then checked for if they satisfy the tests contained in
HydrogenBondType. For this class includes a test for the distance of
the donor and acceptor and the angle between the donor, acceptor, and
the hydrogen atom. In other InteractionType subclasses these tests
will be different and will have different numbers of features possibly.

The aim of MASTic (an extension to the core MAST functionality) is to
provide a set of common interaction types relevant to computational
biology. But it is important to note that anyone could invent any
InteractionType subclass to profile for any kind of "interaction" they
could want to profile. There will likely be separate instructions on
how to create your own interactions in the future.

*** Profiling interactions in *interaction space*

There is one problem with using the above method for profiling
interactions and that is comparing profiling results for different
substantiations of the system. We could come up with a clever indexing
system that uses the indices of both features, but we have opted to
introduce the concept of an *interaction space* where the dimensions
correspond to potential interactions between features.

A point in interaction space then is an n-tuple, where n is the number
of potential interactions, and the values to each potential
interaction describe the degree to which the interaction exists. For
instance we might use a simple boolean value and hard cutoffs for if
the interaction exists, 0 for does not exist and 1 for if the
interaction exists. The implementation of how values are assigned to
the n-tuple is up to the InteractionType class.

Interaction space is similar to a phase space in that we are
representing a whole system state as a single point, however
interaction space greatly reduces the total degrees of freedom in a
complete phase space for a macromolecular system by focusing only on
domain specific features. This is motivated by the molecular design
point of view where for instance a medicinal chemist thinks in terms
of a drug scaffold and functional group additions which interact more
or less specifically to features on the target. The focus on
interactions is so widespread throughout the biological sciences that
it certainly makes sense to frame a system in this way even though
there is the added complexity of parametrizing the scoring functions.

A nice side effect of determining an interaction space before
profiling for interactions is that there is a consistency between
profiling. For instance, if you profile one frame of a molecular
dynamics trajectory you will obtain only a subset of possible
interactions, the set I_1, and another frame the set I_2. The space of
interactions defined by these individually are incompatible, and the
indexing/naming scheme is particular to each one individually (of
course unless there is well designed nomenclature algorithm). So by
defining and indexing/naming all potential interactions ahead of time
we merely profile and fill in the n-tuple.

We can define an interaction space for a single AssociationType or for
the whole system and all possible AssociationTypes, given the number
of participating features needed for an interaction, from here forward
termed the *degree of interaction*. Furthermore, an interaction can be
symmetric or assymetric. An *assymetric interaction* is where the
FeatureTypes that interact are different, and a *symmetric
interaction* is where the FeatureTypes are the same. Hydrogen bonding
and all electrostatic interactions are assymetric and interactions
like hydrophobic or pi-pi stacking can be symmetric (they can be
assymetric if comparing features of different shape).

For an assymetric degree 2 interaction, like hydrogen bonding (one
donor, one acceptor), in the two member system we have four possible
associations: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1).

The order of the elements in these *association tuples* are the
ordering of the FeatureTypes considered in the InteractionType and the
values are the indices of the members between which the interaction
takes place. The list of association tuples we call the *association
polynomial* and each term in this polynomial adds to the possible
dimensions in interaction space. The first and last terms are the
*intramember interaction* associations and the middle terms are the
*intermember interaction* associations.

For a symmetric interaction of degree 2 we have only 3 terms: (0,0),
(0,1), (1,1) because the intermember associations will have the same
results.

Thus the interaction space in a system for an interaction type is the
sum of all possible interactions contained in the association polynomial.

I_tot = I((0,0)) + I((0,1)) + I((1,0)) + I((1,1))

where I(A_i) is the function that takes in an association tuple, A_i,
and outputs a collection of *interaction classes*. I_tot is all
interaction classes in the system for the interaction type in
question. An interaction class is a unique pairing of FeatureTypes for
an InteractionType, i.e. an instantiation of a particular type of
interaction (HydrogenBondType) for particular FeatureTypes (say
Feature_0 and Feature_1). A substantiation of an interaction class is
an Interaction. Interaction types cannot be said to be substantiated.

Okay, now that we have defined some terms to help us think about the
problem we can actually construct an interaction space for our
system. First we get the association tuples for the degree and
symmetry of the interaction.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  # use the association polynomial function of the system
  assoc_terms = Trypsin_Benzamidine_System.association_polynomial(
      # input the degree of the interaction
      interaction_degree=HydrogenBondType.degree,
      # return the indices of the system members instead of the members
      # themselves
      return_idxs=True,
      # whether or not the interaction is symmetric or not
      commutative=False)

#+END_SRC

Because we only have to members and a degree 2 interaction the
polynomial is pretty simple, however for larger systems with
complicated interactions this kind of approach is scalable and
provides a language to communicate in.


Now that we have the association polynomial terms we are interested in
we can create an interaction space of the system.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  hbond_inx_classes = Trypsin_Benzamidine_System.interaction_space(
      assoc_terms, HydrogenBondType)
#+END_SRC

This gives us a list of instantiated HydrogenBondTypes for specific
FeatureType pairs. Check one of them out on the terminal.

We of course could manually specify which association terms we were
interested in. For instance if we only cared about protein donors and
ligand acceptors interacting we could have used the following.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  # the protein is member 1 and the ligand member 0.
  print([member_type.name for member_type in Trypsin_Benzamidine_System.member_types])

  # The order of the feature types for the HydrogenBondType is (donor,
  # acceptor)
  print(HydrogenBondType.feature_order)


  assym_hbond_inx_classes = Trypsin_Benzamidine_System.interaction_space(
      [(1,0)], HydrogenBondType)

#+END_SRC

Now that we have the interaction classes we just pass these to profile
interactions as well and the resulting Interaction objects will be
associated with the proper interaction classes.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  tryp_ben_prof_results = new_system.associations[0].profile_interactions([HydrogenBondType],
                                                        interaction_classes=hbond_inx_classes)
#+END_SRC

*** Analyzing profiling results
