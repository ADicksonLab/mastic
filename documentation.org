** TODO Docstring for register_selection

SHould have an example of a GenericSelection subclass using this.

** TODO refactor SelectionDict to ContainerDict and create KeySelection
Right now the SelectionDict can contain bare containers of selections.
This should be put into two separate classes:

1. ContainerDict :: keeping records of many containers of SelectionMembers
2. KeySelection :: A selection where elements are addressed by a defined key

Does this warrant the need for a Container class?

** TODO Container class implementation
A class for this would reduce redundancy in checking whether each
element is a SelectionMember.

Should allow for insertion of bare containers, like lists, and have
them internally cast to Container classes.

And then the user has the option of declaring them beforehand or not.

** TODO cast elements of containers to SelectionMembers if not specified
Should make it possibly to simply make a Selection from
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  idxsel = IndexedSelection([1,2,3,4], sel=[0,2])
  idxsel[0]

  # returns SelectionMember(1)
#+END_SRC

** DONE Selection class

Right now it makes a dictionary with the keys being the indices from
the sel key-word argument passed in.

Maybe this can stay the same but this leads to obnoxious behavior in
which you don't have a simple list to iterate through but dictionary
records.

Thus I want just a Selection class that simply puts them into a list
and you access them with all the typical list methods.

The IndexedSelection will just be a dictionary with keys enforced to
be >= 0 ints.

*** DONE class

*** DONE docstring
*** DONE tests

** TODO comparisons in the SelectionType class

I don't know if this is very stable way to do things currently as it
relies on the __dict__ which might not reflect all attributes,
e.g. for things in __slots__ which I might use.

** DONE CoordArraySelection refactor inheritance

Do I want it to be a dictionary style or Selection inheritance.
FIgure this out and change in code.

It now just behaves like a list with a manually added data attribute
and a __getitem__ method.

** TODO SelectionType factory

It seems that there should be something for defining a class of
SelectionTypes such that they must have certain attributes.

This sounds like a factory, must figure this out.

** TODO refactor SelectionList to ContainerList
** TODO refactor RDKitMoleculeType class into reader and MoleculeType class

Most of what is in RDKitMoleculeType should be in MoleculeType and
RDKitMoleculeType just needs to be a thin wrapper of MoleculeType with
the to_molecule_from_conformer(conf_idx) function and a get conformer
function.

That way we can read in an RDKitMoleculeType and use that to cast to
the mast agnostic MoleculeType for production.

** TODO make the SystemType and AssociationType classes mean something

Currently they are just stubs. They should have their own libraries.

** TODO make the SystemMember class

This will handle the functions for being a part of a system.

I want to implement a function that recursively searches the registry
for something that is in a system for this.

** TODO handle and create angles in MoleculeType
** TODO allow for parametrized overlap tolerances in Molecule.overlaps
** TODO handle intramember_interactions in Association.profile_interactions
