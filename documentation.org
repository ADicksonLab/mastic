** TODO write logging

** TODO unittests with finding features functions
I was reluctant to use these because rdkit gives me trouble sometimes.
** TODO Type.substantiate function
A general function for use every Type class instead of specific
to_molecule and to_atom methods which need to be handled individually,
e.g. in to_system.

** TODO Type class for things to inherit from.
Would at least provide an interface to implement and override. Need
not be too picky.
** TODO coord_array and array_idx constructor options for Molecule constructor
** DONE finish system and molecule getters for atom, bond, molecule etc classes
** TODO finish dataframe exporters using records
** DONE automatically set the in_molecule and in_system flags when the registry of elements are changed
** DONE type constructor and to_molecule, to_atom, to_bond
** TODO BondType and MoleculeType methods for getting adjacent AtomTypes
** DONE make the AtomType class declaration like BondType and MoleculeType
** DONE AtomType, BondType, MoleculeType
** TODO AngleType implementation 
** TODO Atom.__getitem__ should retrieve something more meaningful
Like say the dimension component.

** TODO Docstring for register_selection

SHould have an example of a GenericSelection subclass using this.

** TODO Container class implementation
A class for this would reduce redundancy in checking whether each
element is a SelectionMember.

Should allow for insertion of bare containers, like lists, and have
them internally cast to Container classes.

And then the user has the option of declaring them beforehand or not.

** TODO cast elements of containers to SelectionMembers if not specified
Should make it possibly to simply make a Selection from
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  idxsel = IndexedSelection([1,2,3,4], sel=[0,2])
  idxsel[0]

  # returns SelectionMember(1)
#+END_SRC

** DONE Selection class

Right now it makes a dictionary with the keys being the indices from
the sel key-word argument passed in.

Maybe this can stay the same but this leads to obnoxious behavior in
which you don't have a simple list to iterate through but dictionary
records.

Thus I want just a Selection class that simply puts them into a list
and you access them with all the typical list methods.

The IndexedSelection will just be a dictionary with keys enforced to
be >= 0 ints.

*** DONE class

*** DONE docstring
*** DONE tests

** DONE CoordArraySelection refactor inheritance

Do I want it to be a dictionary style or Selection inheritance.
FIgure this out and change in code.

It now just behaves like a list with a manually added data attribute
and a __getitem__ method.

** DONE SelectionType factory

It seems that there should be something for defining a class of
SelectionTypes such that they must have certain attributes.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
  mol_attrs = ['name', 'pdb_symbol', 'atom_types']
  MoleculeType = SelectionTypeFactory(mol_attrs)

  water_type = MoleculeType(name="water",
               pdb_symbol="H2O",
               atom_types=['H', 'H', 'O'])

  coords = np.array([[0,0,1], [1,0,0], [0,1,0]])

  water_type.to_molecule(coords)
#+END_SRC


This pattern more or less is implemented for AtomType, BondType, and
MoleculeType see those for reference.

** DONE refactor RDKitMoleculeType class into reader and MoleculeType class

Most of what is in RDKitMoleculeType should be in MoleculeType and
RDKitMoleculeType just needs to be a thin wrapper of MoleculeType with
the to_molecule_from_conformer(conf_idx) function and a get conformer
function.

That way we can read in an RDKitMoleculeType and use that to cast to
the mast agnostic MoleculeType for production.

** TODO make the SystemType and AssociationType classes mean something

Currently they are just stubs. They should have their own libraries.

** TODO make the SystemMember class

This will handle the functions for being a part of a system.

I want to implement a function that recursively searches the registry
for something that is in a system for this.

** TODO handle and create angles in MoleculeType
** TODO allow for parametrized overlap tolerances in Molecule.overlaps
** TODO handle intramember_interactions in Association.profile_interactions
